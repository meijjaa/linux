Industrial IIO configfs support

1. Overview

Configfs is a filesystem-based manager of kernel objects. IIO uses some
objects that could be easily configured using configfs (e.g.: devices,
triggers).

See Documentation/filesystems/configfs/configfs.txt for more information
about how configfs works.

2. Usage

In order to use configfs support in IIO we need to select it at compile
time via CONFIG_IIO_CONFIGFS config option.

Then, mount the configfs filesystem (usually under /config directory):

$ mkdir /config
$ mount -t configfs none /config

At this point, all default IIO groups will be created and can be accessed
under /config/iio. Next chapters will describe available IIO configuration
objects.

3. Software triggers

One of the IIO default configfs groups is the "triggers" groups. It is
automagically accessible when the configfs is mounted and can be found
under /config/iio/triggers.

Software triggers are created under /config/iio/triggers directory. A sofware
trigger name MUST be of the following form:
	* <trigger-type>-<trigger-name>:
Where:
	* <trigger-type>, specifies the interrupt source (e.g: hrtimer)
	* <trigger-name>, spefcifies the IIO device trigger name

We support now to following interrupt sources (trigger types):
	* hrtimer, uses high resolution timers as interrupt source

3.1 Software triggers creation and destruction

As simply as:

$ mkdir /config/triggers/<trigger-type>-<trigger-name>
$ rmdir /config/triggers/<trigger-type>-<trigger-name>
e.g:

$ mkdir /config/triggers/hrtimer-instance1
$ rmdir /config/triggers/hrtimer-instance1

Each trigger can have one or more attributes specific to the trigger type.

3.2 "hrtimer" trigger types attributes

"hrtimer" trigger type has only one attribute:

$ ls /config/triggers/hrtimer-instance1
sampling_frequency

sampling_frequency - represents the period in Hz between two consecutive
iio_trigger_poll calls. By default it is set to 100Hz.
